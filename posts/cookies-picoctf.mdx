## Description

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/

## Information

`Points: 40`

## Hints

(None)

## Solution

1. When you open website you will see something like this.
   ![HomePage of CTF](/posts/cookies-picoctf/homepage.png "HomePage of CTF")

2. As there is a input element in website and placeholder is "snickerdoodle". I typed in "snickerdoodle" and press enter, then I see, `"I love snickerdoodle cookies!"`
   ![I love snickerdoodle cookies!](/posts/cookies-picoctf/snickerdoodle.png "I Love snickerdoodle cookies!")
   Now, when you see devtools cookie page (open devtools using `ctrl + shift + i`), then I can see, change in the `name` cookie from `-1` to `0`.

3. So, I thought to change it to `1`, `2`, `3`...

4. And finally on `name=18` I got the flag, YAY!!! ðŸŽ‰
